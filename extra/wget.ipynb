    "\n",
    "`wget` is classic (circa 1996, but still updated) [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw) in shell for non-interactively downloading web content. It's often used for basic one-time downloads, like `curl` also does for shell or `urllib.urlretrieve` does in-house for Python. But where `wget` really shines is in its extensive customization, including retrying failed connections, following links, and duplicating a remote website's files and structure to the point of having an identical local copy (website mirroring). \n",
