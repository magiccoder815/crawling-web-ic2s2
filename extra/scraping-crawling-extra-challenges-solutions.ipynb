       "'The claim involves a cross-border private equity fund involving some state-owned financial companies in China. Biden served on the management companys board while his father was vice president, but his attorney says that was an unpaid position, that he did not create the company and has not yet received any money, let alone millions. The attorney says Hunter Biden only acquired a minority stake in the investment management company after his father left office. We have found no evidence to contradict that, and Trump hasnt provided any. We also found no evidence that Joe Biden used his position as vice president to enrich his son. Trump has made numerous comments calling for the investigation of Hunter Bidens business dealings in Ukraine and China, which the president suggests involved Joe Biden. We have written about how the president has twisted the facts on theBidens and Ukraine, and here we will address claims related to China. Trump hasrepeatedlyclaimedthatHunter Biden made millions of dollars from China very rapidly while his father was vice president. Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have both claimed that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from China for a private equity fund. When Bidens son walks out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund  and the biggest funds in the world cant get money out of China  and hes there for one quick meeting, and he flies in on Air Force Two, I think thats a horrible thing. I think its a horrible thing, Trumpsaidduring a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sept. 25. During an Oct. 3press conference, Trump called on China to start an investigation into the Bidens. Trump said China probably has enjoyed a sweetheart deal with the U.S. on trade, because they deal like people with Biden, where they give their son a billion and a half dollars. He called it a payoff. China has sincerejectedTrumps call to investigate the Bidens. OnABCs This Weekon Sept. 29, Giuliani rattled off various claims, including saying that Hunter Biden got $1.5 billion from China while [Vice President Biden was] negotiating with China. Giuliani, Sept. 29: And there are three partners, Rosemont Seneca. Thats Hunter Biden and [Christopher Heinz] the stepson of the  of the secretary of state [John Kerry]. The second partner is the Bank of China. And the third partner is a company called Thornton Group.  The $1.5 billion was in a company that was specially established called Bohai Harvest Rosemont Seneca or some crazy name like that. The partners were Joe Bidens son, John Kerrys stepson, the Bank of China, one-third partner at least, and the Thornton Group. That was owned by Whitey Bulgers nephew. Now, thats all out there. You can go and look at it. If Im wrong, Im wrong. It should be investigated. Hunter Biden was involved with the cross-border equity consortium in question, but the $1.5 billion was what the fund hoped to raise in 2014 for investments. It is not the value of the management company in which Hunter Biden now holds a minority share. Its unclear if that $1.5 billion goal was reached in its first year, as the investment fund had forecast, but the companywebsitesays it now manages assets worth the equivalent of over $2.1 billion in U.S. dollars. Giulianis mention of the three partners in Rosemont Seneca is a good place to start. The same year that Barack Obama and Joe Biden took over the White House in 2009, a general partnership formed that brought together Hunter Biden, son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, Christopher Heinz, stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, and Devon Archer, a classmate of Heinzs from Yale. But all three did not participate in all of the deals undertaken under the Rosemont Seneca umbrella, with separate corporations formed for some deals. Such was the case with Biden and Archers foray into China. Heinzs attorneytoldThe Hillthat Heinz had no operating role in Rosemont Seneca and had nothing to do with any of the deals in question in China. Hunter Bidens role is also not as straightforward as the president and Giuliani say, according to Hunter Bidens attorney. But it is true that Hunter Biden and Archer made business overtures to high-ranking Chinese fund leaders as early as 2010. As conservative author Peter Schweizer details in his book Secret Empires, Biden and Archer, along with James Bulger of the consultancy firm the Thornton Group, took several meetings in 2010 with high-profile business and government interests in China. (As Giuliani said, James Bulger is the nephew of mobster Whitey Bulger, but hes alsothe sonof former Massachusetts state Sen. Billy Bulger.) Schweizer came across an account of the meetings posted by the Thornton Group  in Chinese  in which Chinese executives expressed theirwarmwelcome to the Thornton Group, with its US partner Rosemont Seneca chairman Hunter Biden(second son of the now Vice President Joe Biden). According to the Thornton Groups account  a copy of which Schweizer emailed to us  the purpose of the meetings was to explorethe possibility of commercial cooperation and opportunity. Flash forward three years to June 2013, and according to theNew Yorker, Archer,Jonathan Li who ran a Chinese private equity fund, Bohai Capital  and other partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create a cross-border private equity fund which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. (Some of those entities that met in China with Archer and Biden back in 2010,includingrepresentatives from the National Council of Social Security Fund and the Postal Savings Bank of China, ended up investing in the fund managed by BHR.) In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughtersflewon Air Force Two with Joe Biden to China, where the elder Biden was on a diplomatic mission. Hunter Bidens attorney, George Mesires, told theNew York Timesthat Hunter Biden went along because his daughter had been invited and needed a chaperone. Although Hunter Bidentold theNew Yorkerhe conducted no business while in China, he did arrange for a photo op with Li and his father, Joe Biden, in a hotel lobby. Hunter Biden told theNew Yorkerthat the meeting with Li, who would soon after become CEO of BHR, was purely social, and that he did not meet with any Chinese government officials about the fund on that trip. Mesirestold NBCHunter Biden he did not conduct any business on the trip. Mesires also toldNBC Newsthat BHRs initial formation documents were filed in November 2013  the month before the China trip  but that the business was officiallylaunchedwith a business license issued 10 days after the visit. Hunter Biden wasnamedto its board of directors. Archer was a vice chairman of the company and sat on its investment committee. According to a July 10, 2014,Wall Street Journalarticle, A consortium of foreign and Chinese private-equity firms is aiming to raise about $1.5 billion to invest abroad, with the yuan-denominated portion of the fund to be converted to U.S. dollars through Shanghais free-trade zone. Wall Street Journal, July 10, 2014: The fund  launched by Chinese asset managers Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co. and Harvest Fund Management Co. alongside U.S. investment and advisory firms Rosemont Seneca Partners and Thornton Group LLC  started fundraising in the second quarter, and has raised its target to $1.5 billion from an original $1 billion plan, a spokesman at Bank of China International Holdings Ltd. said. BOCI is one of the largest stakeholders in Bohai. The Bohai-Harvest fund is likely one of the biggest Sino-foreign collaborations [between Chinese partners and foreign ones] in private equity to take advantage of the free-trade zones benefits in converting yuan to dollars that can then be invested in foreign companies. The funds are raising a combination of yuan and U.S. dollars. The effort is the latest example private equity pushing boundaries in an area that China hopes will help drive the countrys economic transformation. Normally, China restricts free conversion of its currency. Bohai and its partners are expected to finish fundraising by the end of this year, according to BOCIs spokesman and Lindsay Wright, co-chief executive officer of Harvest Capital Management Co., the subsidiary under Harvest that will hold a direct stake in the joint fund. According to the article, BOCI and Harvest both declined to say how much had been raised at that time. We dont know whether the $1.5 billion goal was ever reached. Nonetheless, thats the origin of the figure cited by Trump and Giuliani. (BHRswebsitesays the assets it now manages are worth over $2.1 billion.) Hunter Bidens attorney says Hunter Biden neither created the management company nor had an ownership stake until well after his father left office. BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company (BHR) is an investment management company that was formed in 2013, George Mesires told us via email. Hunter did not form BHR, was not an initial owner of BHR, and did not own any interest in BHR until October 2017, after his father had left government service. BHR was capitalized with approximately $4.2 million USD from various sources, not $1.5 billion. Hunter did not acquire any interest in BHR until October 2017 when he acquired a 10% interest, which has a $420,000 capital commitment. Trump and Hunter Bidens attorney are talking past each other a bit. Trump says Hunter Biden walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund. Bidens attorney dismissed that figure, saying BHR was capitalized with approximately $4.2 million USD from various sources, not $1.5 billion. The $1.5 billion figure refers to the size of the funds raised for investments. Hunter Biden did serve on BHRs original board of directors while his father was vice president, but Mesires told theWashington Postthat Biden was on the board of the advisory firm that did not directly invest, but instead advised those who did. Mesires told us, Hunter has not received any return on his investment or compensation on account of his position on the board of directors. A BHR representative told theNew Yorkerin July that although Hunter Biden served on the board, he was not a signatory to the BHR deal, and that the deal wasnt with Rosemont Seneca Partners, but rather with a holding company, established solely by Archer. Corporate registration recordsin China  captured by Schweizer in May  show that Rosemont Seneca Thornton LLC owned a 30% stake in BHR. We could not confirm if that was the holding company to which the BHR representatives referred. And Bidens attorney did not respond to our inquiries seeking details about that. Schweizer points to a screen grab from a 2016 version of theBHR websitethat lists Rosemont Seneca Partners as a sponsor of BHR. BHR website, Sept. 7, 2016:Formed in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in December 2013 as its first cross-border investment private equity firm, BHR is the cross-border investment arm of Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management Co., Ltd. (Bohai Capital). Our other sponsors include Harvest Fund Management Co., Ltd (Harvest), Rosemont Seneca Partners (RSP), Thornton Group LLC (Thornton) and our management team. We also enjoy the support of Bank of China, China Development Bank Capital, National Council of Social Security Fund, China Life, Postal Savings Bank of China, among others, as our suite of legacy shareholders through Bohai Capital. But according to Hunter Bidens attorney, Hunter Biden derived no financial benefit from the deal at that time. He was acting as an unpaid director advising investors in the fund. Mesires told theNew York Timesthat while Hunter Biden now has a 10% stake in BHR, which he acquired through a company he created named Skaneateles LLC, there have been no distributions to the shareholders since Hunter has been an equity owner. But that doesnt mean Biden wont eventually make millions from the deal.Steven Kaplan, who conducts research on issues in private equity, venture capital, entrepreneurial finance, corporate governance and corporate finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told us that a private equity fund with $2 billion under management will typically generate fees over its life of hundreds of millions of dollars. It is difficult to imagine, if not incomprehensible, that a 10% stake in those economics is worth only $420K, Kaplan told us via email. The distinction they appear to be making is they capitalized the management company with $4.2 M even if the fund manages $2 B. The value of that management company is likely far in excess of $4.2 M if they are managing $2 B. Kaplan pointed to two large publicly traded private equity firms for reference, both of which have a market value of about 10% of the assets under their management. Using that as a rough guide, that would put the value of Hunter Bidens share closer to $20 million, he said. There are still some unanswered questions about Hunter Biden and his role in the BHR deal, and his attorney did not get back to us when we had follow-up questions. We dont know details, for example, about the BHR representatives claim to theNew Yorkerabout Archer alone setting up a separate holding company apart from Rosemont Seneca Partners to make the initial BHR deal, though the fact that Hunter Biden used a separate corporation to acquire a 10% stake in BHR in 2017 may suggest he did not have any ownership stake prior to that. Although some may speculate about Hunter Bidens activities while on a diplomatic trip with his father in China, Hunter Biden told theWashington Postearlier this year, At no time have I discussed with my father the companys business or my board service. And Joe Biden in Iowa recently said, I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings. In anop-ed for theNew York Timespublished on Oct. 9, Schweizer said Hunter Biden didnt do anything illegal in the China deal. While theForeign Corrupt Practices Actprohibits a U.S.-owned company from hiring the children of foreign government officials in the hopes of currying favor with their powerful parents, Schweizer wrote, it is not a violation if a foreign company hires or does business with the family members of American politicians. Schweizer argues, however, that such cronyism should be illegal. It gives the politically connected class enormously tempting opportunities for self-dealing, the sort of thing that is blatantly illegal in almost any other context, Schweizer wrote, adding that Biden landed a deal in China that he was apparently unqualified to score save for one thing: his father. Hunter Biden is not the first child of a prominent politician to be accused of having ties to a company doing business with a foreign country. Indeed,similar questionshave been raised about Trumps own family members. The president is free to question whether Hunter Biden capitalized on his fathers name to insert himself into a deal that involves investments by the Chinese government. But he goes beyond that to make unsubstantiated claims that Hunter Biden made millions and millions from China while his father was vice president and that he hitched a ride on Air Force Two to secure a $1.5 billion investment deal. Bidens attorney claims that Hunter Biden made no money off the deal while his father served as vice president, and has yet to see any return on his investment. We cannot verify either statement, and we cant say how much Hunter Biden might ultimately make from his 10% stake in BHR. But while Trump has called on China to open an investigation, there has been no evidence presented to date that suggests either Biden did anything illegal.'"
