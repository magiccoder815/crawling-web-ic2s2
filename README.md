# Web-Crawling: A Practical Introduction in Python
## A workshop with the [Massive Data Institute](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/the-massive-data-institute/), Georgetown University


## Overview

When it comes to data collection, web-crawling (i.e., web-scraping, screen-scraping) is a common approach in our increasingly digital era--and a common stumbling block. With such a wide range of tools and languages available (Selenium, Requests, and HTML, to name just a few), developing and implementing a web-crawling pipeline is often a frustrating experience for researchers--especially those without a computer science background.

Whatever your background, this workshop will give you the foundation to use web-crawling in your research. We will tackle common problems including collecting web addresses/URLs (by automated Google search), downloading website copies (with wget), non-scalable website scraping (with requests), and scalable crawling of text and images (with scrapy). No web-crawling experience is required, but some Python know-how is expected. 


## Workshop goals

* TBD


## Prerequisites

We will get our hands dirty implementing an assortment of simple web-crawling tools. To follow along with the code—which is the point—will need some familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. If you haven't programmed in Python or haven’t used Jupyter Notebooks, please do some self-teaching before this workshop using resources like those listed below. 


## Getting started & software prerequisites

For simplicity, just click the "Launch Binder" button (at the top of this Readme) to create a virtual environment ready for this workshop. It may take a few minutes; if it takes longer than 10, try again.

If you want to run the code on your computer, you have two options. You could use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) to make installation easy: [download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) . Or if you already have Python 3.x installed with the full list of libraries listed under `requirements.txt`, you're welcome to clone this repository and follow along on your own machine. You can also install all the necessary packages like so: 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
