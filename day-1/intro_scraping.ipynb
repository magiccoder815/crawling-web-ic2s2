If you need a beginner's introduction to coding in Python, please walk through the intro to Python notebook at `solutions/intro-to-python.ipynb` and/or [this one](https://github.com/lknelson/text-analysis-course/blob/master/scripts/01.25.02_PythonBasics.ipynb) *before* the workshop. \n",

Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations. Don't worry if you haven't seen these before--we will keep it simple. If you want to get more out of this session, first go through [this notebook on regular expressions](https://github.com/lknelson/text-analysis-course/blob/master/scripts/03.20.01_RegularExpressions.ipynb).\n",

    "Here's our high-level description of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The internet is a bunch of computers connected together.** Some computers are laptops, some are desktops, some are smart phones, some are servers owned by companies. Each computer has its own address on the internet. Using these addresses, **one computer can ask another computer for some information (data). We say that the first computer sends a _request_ to the second computer, asking for some particular information. The second computer sends back a _response_**. The response could include the information requested, or it could be an error message. Perhaps the second computer doesn't have that information any more, or the first computer isn't allowed to access that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../assets/computer-network.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that there is an enormous amount of information available on the web. When people put information on the web, they generally have two different audiences in mind, two different types of consumers of their information: humans and computers. If they want their information to be used primarily by humans, they'll make a website. This will let them lay out the information in a visually appealing way, choose colours, add pictures, and make the information interactive. If they want their information to be used by computers, they'll make a web API. A web API provides other computers structured access to their data. We won't cover APIs in this workshop, but you should know that i) APIs are very common and ii) if there is an API for a website/data source, you should use that over web scraping. Many data sources that you might be interested in (e.g. social media sites) have APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Websites are just a bunch of files on one of those computers. They are just plain text files, so you can view them if you want. When you type in the address of a website in your browser, your computer sends a request to the computer located at that address. The request says \"hey buddy, please send me the file(s) for this website\". If everything goes well, the other computer will send back the file(s) in the response**. Everytime you navigate to a new website or page in your browser, this process repeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../assets/request-response.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are three main languages that that website files are written with: HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS)**. They normally have `.html`, `.css` and `.js` file extensions. Each language (and thus each type of file) serves a different purpose. **HTML files are the ones we care about the most, because they are the ones that contain the text you see on a web page**. CSS files contain the instructions on how to make the content in a HTML visually appealing (all the colours, font sizes, border widths, etc.). JavaScript files have the instructions on how to make the information on a website interactive (things like changing colour when you click something, entering data in a form). In this workshop, we're going to focus on HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**It's not too much of a simplification to say:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\textrm{Web scraping} = \\textrm{Making a request for a HTML file} + \\textrm{Parsing the HTML response}\n",

    "## Existing data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before web scraping, see if you can get the same data elsewhere.** This will often be easier for you and preferred by the people who own the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Wikipedia offers an [API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/REST_API) to access their pages. In fact, Wikipedia would prefer that we access their data that way rather than web-scraping. There's even a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) that wraps around this API to make it even easier to use. Wikipedia also makes all of its content available for [direct download](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if you're affiliated with an institution, you may be breaching existing contracts by engaging in scraping. UC Berkeley's Library [recommends](http://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/text-mining) following this workflow:\n",

    "As you've seen, web scraping involves making requests from other computers for their data. It costs people money to maintain the computers that we request data from: it needs electricity, it requires staff, sometimes you need to upgrade the computer, etc. But we didn't pay anyone for using their resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're making these requests programmatically, we could make many, many requests per second. For example, we could put a request in a never-ending loop which would constantly request data from a server. But computers can't handle too much traffic, so eventually this might crash someone else's computer. Moreover, if we make too many requests when we're web scraping, that might restrict the number of people who can view the web page in their browser. This isn't very nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Websites often have Terms of Service, documents that you agree to whenever you visit a site. Some of these terms prohibit web scraping, because it puts too much strain on their servers, or they just don't want their data accessed programmatically. Whatever the reason, we need to respect a websites Terms of Service. **Before you scrape a site, you should always check its terms of service to make sure it's allowed.**"
