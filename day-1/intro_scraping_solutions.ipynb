Be sure to use a polite `--wait` and avoid downloading anything with massive numbers of links, files, or pages (e.g., don't try YouTube.com or Wikipedia.com). If you want to download a segment or specific page within a website (e.g., a single YouTube channel or Wikipedia page), use the `--recursive` option with `--no-parent` (to follow only links within the input URL).\n",
